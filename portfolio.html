        I implemented a CNN in Python using PyTorch and SciKit-Learn to classify clothing images from the fashion-mnist dataset. 
        The model's architecture featured an Adam optimizer with Cross Entropy Loss and was trained over 30 epochs, comprising 84,058 parameters. 
        The structure included two Convolutional layers, two fully connected layers with dropout, and concluded with the output layer. 
        Ultimately, the model achieved an impressive 89.6% accuracy during testing.

        In a programming studio course, my team of two others and I collaborated on building a web app designed to assist campers and 
        hiking enthusiasts in planning trips to national parks. Employing an Agile development process, my specific responsibilities included crafting 
        an algorithm for park selection and activity discovery. 
        Additionally, I played a key role in developing a tool that allows users to generate and save trip itineraries.

        In a previous course of mine, we were assigned a final project to
        complete. My team and I decided to build an 3 stage audio amplifier

        circuit and simulating until our simulation results were up to our
        expectations. Below is the circuit that our team eventually designed.

        Another completed project I am proud of is making a CPU entirely in
        verilog. The design of the CPU is dated, from the late 80s, but the
        overall concepts apply to modern day processors since we built it to use
