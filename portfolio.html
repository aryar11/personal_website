    <h2>Built an Audio Amplifier</h2>
    <h3>
      In a previous course of mine, we were assigned a final project to
      complete. My team and I decided to build an 3 stage audio amplifier using
      bipolar transistors. This was a huge challenge itself, spending several
      days designing the circuit and simulating until our simulation results
      were up to our expectations. Below is the circuit that our team eventually
      designed.

    <h2>Wrote a Processor in Verilog</h2>
    <h3>
      Another completed project I am proud of is making a CPU entirely in
      verilog. The design of the CPU is dated, from the late 80s, but the
      overall concepts do apply to modern day processors. You can see the layout
      of the CPU below.
