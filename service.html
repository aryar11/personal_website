        Howdy! Welcome to my personal website; my name is Arya Rahmanian and I
        am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University. Throughout my
        experience as a student, I’ve become interested in pursuing Computer
        Architecture. I’m inspired by how this field combines software and
        hardware into how a computer will work, almost like building a puzzle
        but with an exponentially higher learning curve. Starting when the first
        computer was built in WWII, this field is always developing and becoming
        more complex as there is always a need for more computing power in
        today’s world. There is never a dull moment with computer architecture.
      </p>

        A small project I once worked on for a class is that I built a CPU
        entirely in Verilog. Granted, this was a CPU from the 1980s, but it
        could still perform the basic functions that a modern day CPU could
        perform, likely much slower.

        Even though my courses take up most of my time, I'm still able to give
        back to my community that has helped me so much. Over the years I've
        been involved in Eta Kappa Ku, Arab Aggie Engineering Association,
        UNICEF, Photography Club, PALS, and was a counselor for a local
        religious camp in Dallas called CFT. My most fond memory of service
        would be my experience as a staff at the camp CFT, Change For Tomorrow.
        The members of the camp were 12-14 years old and I was responsible for
        creating programs throughout the day as well as making sure everyone was
        getting along. I enjoyed it so much because I was given a lot of
        responsibility over the members, and it was able to teach me a lot about
        being a leader and having others follow what you say. Not only that, I
        also had a great time working with these junior youth and I’m proud of
        the work I accomplished.
