          Howdy and Welcome to my personal website! My name is Arya Rahmanian and I
          am a Computer Engineering Masters student at Texas A&M University. Throughout
          my experience as a student, Iâ€™ve become interested in pursuing
          Computer Architecture and embedded systems. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though my courses take up most of my time, I'm still able to give
          back to my community that has helped me so much. Over the years I've
          been involved in IEEE and the Baha'i club. Between both of these organizations, I am able to give back to my fellow students, helping advance their
          careers, and also to the community. In IEEE, I served as a corporate officer helping organizing industry talks to our A&M chapter. While in 
          Baha'i club, I served the community around Texas A&M by participating in service projects such as the Big Event and volunteering at the Brazos Valley Food Bank.
